This project aims to provide data in the form of a new backend API on health metrics of climbers along with other associated climbing data. This involves access to more specific metrics on freuqncy, intensity, grade, style, and location of climbing, as well as the standard health metrics of weight, height, blood pressure, age, and more. These are then processed and used to display helpful data and interact with the user to give informative and live feedback before, during, and after climbing. This will all function on a database containing user data stored in a series of relations that allow for efficient and easily leveraged data manipulation.
